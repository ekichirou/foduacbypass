This is my custom BOF i have developed while going through CRTO.<br>
It uses 3 manually executed commands from the CNA and a LOLBAS method to bypass AV signature and behavioral detection.
<p></p>
1. Had CNA tha can be loaded in Cobalt Strike and used. Check `help foduacbypass`.<br>
2. It uses 3 stages to bypass behavioral detection.<br>
3. It uses LOLBAS wlrmdr.exe method to execute the given implant and fodhelper.exe
